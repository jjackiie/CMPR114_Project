1. Your project's objective(s)
    - Use Python and OpenAPI to implement a ChatGPT session
2. Your project plan - what needs to be done and who does what
    - implement a ChatGPT
    - create a class that for the chat session
    - create a function to generate responses from OpenAPI
    - define a dictionary
    - create a tuple of for exit commands
    - create a repeat loop using "while" to ask the user
    - using a exception handling like "try" blocks to catch and
      handle exceptions
3. You plan to cover the the requirements - what feature satisfies
   which requirements.
   - Using a while statement the will satisfy the use of repeat loop
   - The whole program will generally satisfy the use of function
   - Defining a list of possible responses for unrecognized input
     will satisfy the use of list
   - Define a dictionary of prompts fro different chat topics will
     satisfy the use of dictionaries
   - Using __init__ method will satisfy the use of object oriented
4. Your test plan - how do you plan to test
    - In our draft process, testing will be done manually. Once, the
    program evolves we will try to proceed with unit testing.
5. Your presentation plan - how do you plan to present your work, results.
    - We plan to use a powerpoint to explain the application objective,
      application design, show here the code implements Python features
      and explain how the application was tested. After the powerpoint,
      give a live demonstration of our project.
